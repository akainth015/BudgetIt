# BudgetIt

BudgetIt processes a `.csv` file that contains your transaction history in it (this can be obtained from your bank) and uses Jaccard similarity to 
group related purchases together, making it easier to analyze your spending without having to meticulously log each transaction individually.

It can be run from IntelliJ IDEA.
